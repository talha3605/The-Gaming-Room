# The-Gaming-Room

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they would like to make their browser game able to run on multiple platforms. The game is only available on Android and is named “Draw It or Lose It”. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did particularly well in developing this documentation is being able to keep the design template clear, concise, and to the point.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It assists in keeping your focus on the task on hand and also to decide on what tasks are important and which ones don't need time and focus on. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work to revise, I would choose the recommendations section. I would improve it by discussing more factors about my recommendation for an operating system that will allow for future expansion of this gaming system.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the functionality of the game and split it up so that there would be less time and work spent on expanding to other operating platforms while still keeping the game the same. The client may be the one to ask you to do the work, but it is the user who really controls the product. If they do not trust the software or have issues with it, then they won't use it. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put all of my focus and attention on clear documentation in order to allow for more easier maintenence and updates.
